Summary
I’m a technology leader and entrepreneur. I'm applying AI to a field
where it can make a massive impact: helping people discover their
potential and pursue their reason for being. But at my core, I’m a
software engineer and a scientist. I learned how to code aged 8 and
still spend weekends experimenting with Large Language Models
and writing code (rather badly). If you’d like to join us to show me
how it’s done.. message me!
As a work-hobby, I absolutely love giving talks about Gen AI and
LLMs. I'm the author of a best-selling, top-rated Udemy course
on LLM Engineering, and I speak at O'Reilly Live Events and
ODSC workshops. It brings me great joy to help others unlock the
astonishing power of LLMs.
I spent most of my career at JPMorgan building software for financial
markets. I worked in London, Tokyo and New York. I became an MD
running a global organization of 300. Then I left to start my own AI
business, untapt, to solve the problem that had plagued me at JPM -
why is so hard to hire engineers?
At untapt we worked with GQR, one of the world's fastest growing
recruitment firms. We collaborated on a patented invention in AI
and talent. Our skills were perfectly complementary - AI leaders vs
recruitment leaders - so much so, that we decided to join forces. In
2020, untapt was acquired by GQR’s parent company and Nebula
was born.
I’m now Co-Founder and CTO for Nebula, responsible for software
engineering and data science. Our stack is Python/Flask, React,
Mongo, ElasticSearch, with Kubernetes on GCP. Our 'secret sauce'
is our use of Gen AI and proprietary LLMs. If any of this sounds
interesting - we should talk!
